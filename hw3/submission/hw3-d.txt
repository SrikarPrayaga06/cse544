The DBMS that we use in this assignment is running somewhere in one of Microsoft's data centers. 
Comment on your experience using this DBMS cloud service. What do you think about the idea of offering a DBMS  as a service in a public cloud?


I had an overall good experience using Azure DB but the experience of importing data on the cloud could have been improved. How about creating a button for "import the data" on the panel (https://portal.azure.com)? 

Cloud DBMS became popular these days because it promises to takes care of scalability and high availability of the database. However, to deliver a successful service, there are a few challenges we need to solve-- such as internet speed, privacy, query workload and transactional workloads, etc.
