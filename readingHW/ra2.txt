1. Describe briefly what "normal form" means as presented in the paper. 
What are the advantages of this normal form?

Normal form means if and only if the domain of each attribute contains only atomic (indivisible) values, and the value of each attribute contains only a single value from that domain.
The advantages of the normal forms are following:
First, it would be devoid of pointers (address-valued or displacement-valued). Second, it would avoid all dependence on hash addressing schemes. Third, it would contain no indices or ordering lists.


2. What is "composition" and why is it important for the relational operations presented in the paper? What would happen if the relational operators don't "compose"?

Two relations are composable if and only if they are joinable. If the relational operators don't "compose", we don't have the ability to run a query over the result of our previous query.
