Please read Sections 1-4 of "What goes around comes around" 
and answer the following questions (a brief answer suffices):

Q. Why did CODASYL not provide physical data independence?

A. Because there was no high level language in CODASYL and the storage organization has to hash the record. Tables prescribe how they are implemented / stored on disk. Therefore, application programs breaks if the storage organization changes. 

Q. What led to Ted Codd designing the relational data model? What were the issues with previous data models at the time?

A. For CODASYL, there was no physical data independence (for above reasons) nor logical data independence since the schema cannot change without affecting application programs. And it was record-at-a-time programming language that one enters the database at an entry point and then navigates to desired data by following sets. Moreover, it was not flexible enough to easily represent 3-way (or more) situations because CODASYL sets are only 2-way relationships. 

These issues led the mathematician to design the relational models.
