# CSEP 544 Reading Assignments

Add a `readingHW` folder to your gitlab repo and write your responses in 
`readingHW/ra1.txt` (for the first reading assignment), `readingHW/ra2.txt` 
(for the second assignment), etc. 
Submit your response using `turnInHw.sh ra1`, `turnInHw.sh ra2`, etc before
the deadline.

Since we will be discussing the papers in class, students will not be allowed
to use late days on them.

### Assignment 1 (Due on Oct 10, before class)
<a name="ra1"></a>

Please read Sections 1-4 of "What goes around comes around" 
([csenetid](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/csep544/17au/csenetid/goes-around.pdf), 
[uwnetid](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/csep544/17au/uwnetid/goes-around.pdf)) and answer the 
following questions (a brief answer suffices):

1. Why did CODASYL not provide physical data independence?
2. What led to Ted Codd designing the relational data model? What were the issues with previous data models
at the time?


### Assignment 2 (Due on Oct 17, before class)

Please read Sections 1.3, 1.4, 2.1 of "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks"
(feel free to skim the rest)
([csenetid](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/csep544/17au/csenetid/codd.pdf), 
[uwnetid](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/csep544/17au/uwnetid/codd.pdf)) and answer the 
following questions (one paragraph per question suffices):

This paper is the original work that proposes the relational data model, hence some of the terms
might be different from what we call them today.

1. Describe briefly what "normal form" means as presented in the paper. 
What are the advantages of this normal form?
2. What is "composition" and why is it important for the relational operations presented in the paper? What would happen if the relational operators don't "compose"?
